    "MongoDB is a **non-relational** and **document-oriented** database that uses flexible documents instead of tables and rows to store and query various forms of data. It supports JSON-like storage and provides an elastic data storage model that simplifies database management and enables scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL,” which stands for Not Only SQL. The main difference between these and relational databases is how they store their information. A non-relational database stores data in a non-tabular form, and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based, relational database structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized. Non-relational databases often perform faster because a query doesn’t have to view several tables in order to deliver an answer, as relational datasets often do."

    "Some important features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "- **Support for ad hoc queries**: In MongoDB, you can search by field, range query and it also supports regular expression searches.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "- **Replication**: MongoDB supports Master Slave replication. A master can perform Reads and Writes and a Slave copies data from the master and can only be used for reads or back up (not writes).\n",
    "- **Load balancing**: It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "- **Document Oriented**: MongoDB stores the main subject in the minimal number of documents and not by breaking it up into multiple relational structures like RDBMS."
