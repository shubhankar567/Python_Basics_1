    "In Python, when creating a custom exception, it is important to derive the new class from the built-in `Exception` class. This allows us to improve the quality of error messages, centralize error handling, make our code more modular and maintainable, and handle complex error scenarios."

The function checks if the class is a subclass of `BaseException`, and if it is, it prints the class name indented by the specified amount. Then it calls itself recursively on each of the subclasses of the given class, increasing the indentation level by 4 each time. Finally, the function is called on `builtins.BaseException` with an initial indentation level of 0 to print the entire exception hierarchy."

    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design for failure**: Plan ahead by considering possible failures and designing your program to handle them gracefully. This means anticipating edge cases and implementing appropriate error handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a single except block to catch all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Don't use exceptions for flow control**: Exceptions should be used for exceptional situations, not as part of normal program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle exceptions at the appropriate level**: Handle exceptions at the level that knows how to handle them. For some exceptions, like programming errors (e.g. `IndexError`, `TypeError`, `NameError` etc.) exceptions are best left to the programmer/user, because \"handling\" them will just hide real bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Don't catch every exception**: Avoid using a bare except clause that catches all exceptions. Instead, catch only the exceptions that you know how to handle."
