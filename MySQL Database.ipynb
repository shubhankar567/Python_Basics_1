    "A **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of databases: **SQL** (relational databases) and **NoSQL** (non-relational databases). \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a relational model that works best with well-defined structured data, such as names and quantities, in which relations exist between different entities. SQL databases are scalable vertically, meaning that you can increase the maximum load by adding further storage components like RAM or SSD. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a manner other than the tabular relations used within SQL databases. NoSQL databases are suitable for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They don't follow a rigid schema but instead have more flexible structures to accommodate their data-types. NoSQL databases are scalable horizontally, meaning that they use multiple nodes in a cluster to handle increased workloads."

    "**DDL** stands for **Data Definition Language** and is a subset of SQL and a part of DBMS (Database Management System). DDL consists of commands like **CREATE**, **ALTER**, **TRUNCATE**, and **DROP**. These commands are used to create or modify the tables in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: This command is used to create a new table in SQL. The user has to give information like table name, column names, and their datatypes. For example, if we need to create a table for storing student information of a particular college, the syntax would be: ` CREATE TABLE Student_info (College_Id number(2), College_name varchar(30), Branch varchar(10));`.\n",
    "- **ALTER**: This command is used to add, delete or change columns in the existing table. The user needs to know the existing table name and can do add, delete or modify tasks easily. For example, if we want to add a new column for CGPA in our Student_info table, the syntax would be: `ALTER TABLE Student_info ADD CGPA number;`.\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE**: This command is used to remove all rows from the table, but the structure of the table still exists. For example, if the college authority wants to remove the details of all students for new batches but wants to keep the table structure, they can use the command: `TRUNCATE TABLE Student_info;`.\n",
    "- **DROP**: This command is used to remove an existing table along with its structure from the database. For example, if the college authority wants to change their database by deleting the Student_info table, they can use the command: `DROP TABLE Student_info;`."
