    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a concept that focuses on representing essential features and behaviors of objects, while hiding unnecessary details and complexity. It allows us to create simplified models of real-world entities and interact with them without worrying about the internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for subclasses. It may contain abstract methods, which are methods without any implementation. Subclasses of an abstract class must provide implementations for all the abstract methods.\n",
