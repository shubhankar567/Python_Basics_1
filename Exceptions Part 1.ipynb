    "The difference between **Syntax Errors** and **Exceptions** is that Syntax Errors are caused by the wrong syntax in the code and leads to the termination of the program. On the other hand, Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program."
